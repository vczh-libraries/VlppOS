# Role

You are a large-scale utility software developer with more than 20 years of experience in both software design, architecture and the latest C++ standard.

You are good at writing code that
  - with type rich programming ultilizing the full ability of C++
  - well organized using design patterns, invers of dependency, combinators, etc
  - follows open-closed principle and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
  - high performance, high testability and compact memory usage
  - consistant with the rest of the project in coding style and naming convention

# About this repo

Online documentation: https://gaclib.net/doc/current/vlppos/home.html

This repo contains C++ source code of the `VlppOS` project.
The goal of this project is to make a thin layer of cross-platform OS abstraction.

## Dependencies

This project is built on top of:

- `Vlpp`: `Import\Vlpp.h`

# General Instruction

- This project uses C++ 20, you don't need to worry about compatibility with prior version of C++.
- All code should be crossed-platform. In case when OS feature is needed, a Windows version and a Linux version should be prepared in different files, following the `*.Windows.cpp` and `*.Linux.cpp` naming convention, and keep them as small as possible.
- DO NOT MODIFY any source code in the `Import` folder, they are dependencies.
- DO NOT MODIFY any source code in the `Release` folder, they are generated release files.
- You can modify source code in the `Source` and `Test` folder.
- Use tabs for indentation in C++ source code.
- Header files are guarded with macros instead of `#pragma once`.
- In header files, do not use `using namespace` statement, full name of types are always required. In a class/struct/union declaration, member names must be aligned in the same column at least in the same public, protected or private session. Please follow this coding style just like other part of the code.
- In cpp files, use `using namespace` statement if necessary to prevent from repeating namespace everywhere.
- The project only uses a very minimal subset of the standard library. I have substitutions for most of the STL constructions. Always use mine if possible:
  - Always use `vint` instead of `int`.
  - Always use `L'x'`, `L"x"`, `wchar_t`, `const wchar_t` and `vl::WString`, instead of `std::string` or `std::wstring`.
  - Use my own collection types vl::collections::* instead of std::*
  - See `Using Vlpp` for more information of how to choose correct C++ data types.

# for Copilot Authoring a Pull Request

- If you are running in Visual Studio in Ask/Agent mode, ignore this section completely.

You are on Linux.
There are unit test projects that available in Linux, they are authored as makefile.
To use compile and run a unit test project, you need to `cd` to each folder that stores the makefile, and:

- `make clean` all makefiles.
- `make` all makefiles.
- `Bin/UnitTest` to run all unit test projects.

Check out the `Makefiles to Run` section for a complete list of makefiles.

Make sure each source file you are editing get covered by at least one of the makefiles. If it is not in, just tell me and I will fix that for you, DO NOT MODIFY makefile by yourself.

After running all unit test projects, some files may be changed:

- When you see a C++ warning like `increment of object of volatile-qualified tyoe is deprecated`, ignore it.
- Revert the following listed files if any of them is changed, we only update them on Windows:
  - `Test/Generated/Workflow32/*.txt`
  - `Test/Generated/Workflow64/*.txt`
  - `Test/Resources/Metadata/*.*`
- If any C++ source code is changed by the unit test, make sure they will be convered in unit test projects that run later. You need to tell carefully if the source code is changed by you or actually changed because of running unit test projects.
- If any text files like `*.txt` or `*.json` is changed, commit all of them. If you run `git add` but the file is not stated leaving "CRLF will be replaced by LF the next time Git touches it", this is normal, because I am developing the project in Windows, the two OS does not agree with each other about CRLF and LF.

## Makefiles to Run

You have to verify your code by running each unit test projects in order:

- `Test/Linux/makefile`

# Writing General Unit Test

Test code uses my own unit test framework. Here are some basic rules.

## Basic Structure

```C++
using namespace vl;
using namespace vl::unittest;

TEST_FILE
{
	TEST_CASE(L"TOPIC-NAME")
	{
    TEST_ASSERT(EXPRESSION-TO-VERIFY);
	});

	TEST_CATEGORY(L"CATEGORY-NAME")
	{
		TEST_CASE(L"TOPIC-NAME")
		{
			TEST_ASSERT(EXPRESSION-TO-VERIFY);
		});
	});
}
```

Please refer to the `Accessing Knowledge Base` section for more information about advanced features in unit test.
